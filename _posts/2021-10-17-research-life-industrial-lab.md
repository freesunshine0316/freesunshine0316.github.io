My Experience on the "Domain-Shift" after Joining a Research Lab
======

This blog mainly talks about my experience on a "domain-shift" of research after graduation.
It is a following post of my previous blog [Three Types of Research](https://github.com/freesunshine0316/freesunshine0316.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2021-10-12-three-type-research.md), and some of the concepts are based on that.

Before graduating from my PhD program, I used to produce plenty of "cool" ideas, most of which can yield papers in top conferences.
In the first two years after graduation, I observe a significant reduce on my idea production.
This borders me for a long while, even making me wonder if I should keep doing research or switch to do applied research in a production team.
For many times, I ask myself what causes this situation, and I got a clear answer recently: 
it is because that's the "domain-shift" process from "Prospective Research" to "Goal-driven Research".
During that process, my mind firstly rejects most of the unpractical ideas, before even stop coming up with such ideas.

Now, I can frankly accept this change.
For me, "Prospective Research" is somehow much easier than "Goal-driven Research", as that is purely prophetic and you can think whatever you want.
This type of research is the cornerstone for the development of the whole area, as one big "Prospective Research" can result in a huge breakthrough.
But, probably 1 out of one hundred thousand research papers can be a big one.
On the other hand, you need to think from the production side when conducting "Goal-driven Research".
Sometimes you have to even propose new tasks, because of the gap between existing tasks and the real need in the production side.
