I am currently a senior researcher at Tencent AI Lab working on Language Understanding and Parsing. In addition to that, I'm also interested in Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE) and Machine Translation (MT). I earned my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science Department at the University of Rochester, where I'm honored to have Professor [Daniel Gildea](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AAJjmoIAAAAJ&hl=en) as my academic advisor. I got my Bachelor's degree from Northeastern University (China), where I participated in several ACM/ICPC competitions. After that, I earned my master degree from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (ICT/CAS). I'm very lucky to be advised by Professor [Qun Liu](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=2HhiGzcAAAAJ&hl=en), who brings me to this wonderful and exciting area on natural language processing. During my master program, I laid a solid foundation on Statistical Machine Translation, POS tagging and Parsing.
