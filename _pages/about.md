I am currently a senior researcher at Tencent AI Lab working on Language Understanding and Parsing (NLU), Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE) and Machine Translation (MT). I earned my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science Department at the University of Rochester, and I'm honored to have Professor Daniel Gildea as my advisor. I got my Bachelor's degree from Northeastern University (China) where I participated in several ACM/ICPC competitions. After undergraduate study, I started my master degree at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (ICT/CAS). I'm very lucky to be advised by Professor Qun Liu, who brings me to this wonderful and exciting area. During my master program, I laid a solid foundation on Statistical Machine Translation, POS tagging and Parsing.
