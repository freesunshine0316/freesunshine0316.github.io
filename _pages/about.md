I am currently a final-year PhD candidate advised by Professor Daniel Gildea in the Computer Science Department at the University of Rochester. My current research areas are Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE) and Machine Translation (MT). I got my Bachelor's degree from Northeastern University (China) where I participated in several ACM/ICPC competitions. After undergraduate study, I started my master degree at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (ICT,CAS). I'm very lucky to be advised by Professor Qun Liu, who brings me to this wonderful and exciting area. During my master program, I laid a solid foundation on Statistical Machine Translation, POS tagging and Parsing.
