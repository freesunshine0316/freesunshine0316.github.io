I am currently a senior researcher at Tencent AI Lab working on Dialogue Modeling, Language Understanding, Semantic Parsing and Syntactic Parsing. In addition to that, I'm also interested in Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE) and Machine Translation (MT). I earned my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science Department at the University of Rochester, where I'm honored to have Professor [Daniel Gildea](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AAJjmoIAAAAJ&hl=en) as my academic advisor. I got my Bachelor's degree from Northeastern University (China), where I was a major member of the ACM/ICPC club there. After that, I earned my master degree from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (ICT/CAS). I'm lucky to be advised by Dr. [Qun Liu](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=2HhiGzcAAAAJ&hl=en), who brings me to this exciting research field.
