I am a senior researcher at Tencent AI Lab working on Search and RL to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs. I am especially interested in improving the scaling efficiency of both Search and Learning. I have been working on NLP fields since 2010. I earned my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science Department at the University of Rochester (UofR), advised by Professor [Daniel Gildea](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AAJjmoIAAAAJ&hl=en). I earned my master degree from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (ICT/CAS), advised by Dr. [Qun Liu](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=2HhiGzcAAAAJ&hl=en).
